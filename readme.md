# World Capital Quiz 🌍

This is a simple yet engaging World Capital Quiz that I developed while learning PostgreSQL. The quiz runs on localhost and integrates PostgreSQL with EJS, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📜 Features
- **Interactive Quiz**: Displays a country name, and the user has to enter the corresponding capital city.
- **Scoring System**: Each correct answer increases the score by one. The next country name is displayed until the user inputs a wrong answer.
- **End Game Popup**: Upon a wrong answer, a popup appears showing the final score and an option to restart the game.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing and retrieving the country-capital data.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: For templating and rendering the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the quiz interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the quiz logic and user interactions.
